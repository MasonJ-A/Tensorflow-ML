# Tensorflow_LinEst_and_DNNEs
As long as you have all the appropriate dependencies you can just select run all and you will run both the linear classifier and the DNN classifier, if you want to run them you can run all cells but the cells where the classifiers are being trained and tested, the  ust run the train and test cell individually
